#Photo Director

RESTful javascript application.
Originally created, to get a feeling for javascript web aplications and started after the compulsory warm-up: [Todo apps](http://app.webpremiere.de)

Lives inside a CakePHP installation

For everyone who isn't familiar with Cake directory structure and want go direct to the javascript source code:
-> /app/webroot/js/spine/app/director
